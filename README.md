# React Native Redux Saga TypeScript

## :star: Features

This template contains everything needed to start a serious project.

- Elegant usage directly within the [React Native CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli)
- Consistent with the default React Native template
- Comes with configured Redux, Saga, Logger and few usefull packages
- Minimal additional dependencies
- Fully customizable

## :arrow_forward: Usage

```sh
react-native init MyApp --template react-native-template-redux-saga-ts
```

Replace `MyApp` with your project's name.

It can take a lot of time to run, you might think that it's stuck at 
`Installing required CocoaPods dependencies` but you just have to wait.

## :warning: React Native CLI

This template only works with the new CLI. Make sure you have uninstalled the legacy `react-native-cli` first (`npm uninstall -g react-native-cli`) for the below command to work. If you wish to not use `npx`, you can also install the new CLI globally (`npm i -g @react-native-community/cli` or `yarn global add @react-native-community/cli`).

If you tried the above and still get the react-native-template-react- native-template-typescript: Not found error, please try adding the `--ignore-existing` flag to [force npx to ignore](https://github.com/npm/npx#description) any locally installed versions of the CLI and use the latest.
